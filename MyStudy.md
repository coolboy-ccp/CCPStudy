A few days ago,I was in touch RAC.A lot of blog said RAC is very easy to use.So I'm trying to learn RAC.
Soon I found a lot of things that I had never been exposed to before.Like cocoaPods,RealReachability,etc.
So I decided to learn the knowledge from the beginning. By the way, consolidate some of the previous knowledge.
These are my study notes.There are some unreasonable places hope that we can point out.
Only novice level exchange.
